	comments
    12.Update Market-Feed code so that SendToMarket is called from sponsor
	code.  Harness now passes pointer to SendToMarketInterface to sponsor
	implementation; frame/transaction output arrays have been removed;
	SendToMarket processing in frame has been removed.
    13.CETxnInputGenerator.cpp now uses exec_is_owner tunable properly
    14.Revisions to TxnHarnessSendToMarketInterface.h; new public methods
	SendToMarketFromFrame (for use in Market-Feed) and
	SendToMarketFromHarness (for use in Trade-Order).
    15.CETxnIntputGenerator.cpp - implement generic functions for computing
	trade IDs and trade DTS values, used in Trade-Lookup and Trade-Update
    16.Random.cpp:  Add start-of-range value to NURnd(), adjust callers for
	new NURnd() API, change AValue to 32-bit

	tunables; update CCE class to use logger methods
    18.Add DriverTypes.h, contains enum and string representations of various
	driver types (CE, MEE, DM, etc)
    19.Various C++ cleanups in FlatXYZLoad.h
    20.Add "custom" loader capability to EGenLoader.cpp
    21.CDM, CCE, CMEE constructors changed so that ALL constructurs take a
	UniqueId parameter; useful to identify driver instances when logging
    22.Remove unused constructors from CompanyFile.h, SecurityFile.h,
	CompanyCompetitorFile.h
    23.Update ConvertTradeTypeIdToEnum() in CMEETickerTape to check all
	characters of a trade-type; existing implementation would not fail on
	certain corrupted trade-types (Example:  XLB would be treated as a
	limit-buy)
    24.General code cleanup wrt INT32/int, Tident usage
    25.BETA1 RELEASED

	Workdays (8-hour days) of initial trades to populate. Per motion 220.
    13.Rolled in changes from C.R. (DailyMarketTable.h, MiscConsts.h,
	TradeGen.h, CETxnInputGenerator.cpp) per motion 221 to
	    Implement a 5-day work week - no trading on Saturday or Sunday
	    Move start date for Financial and Daily Market data to Monday
		January 3, 2000 (end date is now Friday December 31, 2004).
	    Make start date for initial trades Monday January 3, 2005.
    14.Removed -u flag from EGenLoader since setting the load unit to anything
	other than 1000 will break a lot of internal code.
    15.Added EGenDriverCELib to makefile.
    16.Changed TTradeLookupFrame3Output. holding_history_id from INT32 to

    1.TradeId type is 64-bit integer (flat files still output only 32-bits).
    2.No dublication of row-reading functions for some tables (that are
	completely defined in flat files).
    3.Non-uniform trading by customer tier (a single function for both
	EGenLoader and CDriverInput to select a customer).
    4.Fixed bug in TradeGen.h where a time shift occurred after 25 days of
	initial trading. The internal elapsed time was being fed into
	CDateTime class as ms only (although Add() function allows days too).

Changes 3.4 => 3.5 by D.J.
    1.Added transaction harness and input generation for Trade Lookup
	transaction.


Changes 3.4 => 3.5 by S.V.

	initial trade generation.
    4.Removed HoldingAndTradeCommonData.h because of the new method of initial
	trade generation.

Changes 3.3 => 3.4 by D.J.
    1.See RNGUsage.xls for many changes
    2.Changed CRandom::RndAlphaNumFormated to RndAlphaNumFormatted
    3.Changed RNG seeding in CPerson::GetTaxID to account for the fact that
	the call to RndAlphaNumFormatted consumes 14 RNG values. This makes
	tax IDs independent rather than overlapping 13 out of 14 characters.
    4.Changed CCustomerAccountsAndPermissionsTable::GetCIDsForPermissions to
	use a separate RNG sequence for generating each of the additional
	permissions.
    5.Changed many places where "Holdings" was being used when really it was
	"Securities".

Changes 3.3 => 3.4 by S.V.
    6.EGenLoader.cpp: removed TableIDs enumeration because it is not used
	anywhere (after the addition of loader class factory).
    7.Editorial changes: renamed in table generation classes
    iCount to iCustomerCount
    iCustCount to iCustomerCount
    iStartingID to iStartFromCustomer
    iDefStartCustId to iDefaultStartFromCustomer
    8.CustomerTable.h: iStartFromCustomer is now 1-based instead of 0-based
    9.Moved functions that generate and load tables (Generate*Table) from
	EGenLoader.cpp into a new class CGenerateAndLoad.
    10.Windows only: added new project EGenGenerateAndLoad.
    11.Tables loaded from flat files (CCharge, CCommissionRateTable, etc.):
	encapsulated input file name in the constructor. Only the directory
	name where the input file is located is passed in.
    12.EGenLoader.cpp: added -b and -xt (replaces old -x[N,S,L,D]) options.
    13.CAddressTable, CBrokerTable, CWatchListsAndItemsTable: added an ability
	to generate data for a subset of customers (not starting from the
	first customer).
    14.ODBC loaders: removed table lock hint to enable parallel load.
    15.FinancialTable.h: modified to generate earnings per share, margin, and
	dividend data only if total earnings are positive (which also cannot
	exceed total revenue). Earnings per share are calculated using total
	earnings and the number of shares outstanding.
    16.TxnHarness*.h: added Cleanup(void *pException) method to allow error
	handling by the database class.
    17.DriverInput.cpp: removed default broker from calculation of the broker
	list for BrokerVolume.
    18.CDriverInput: separated generation of a random customer in many places
	into one private function GenerateRandomCustomerId();
    19.DriverInput.cpp: renamed CID to iCustomerId.

Changes 3.2 => 3.3 by D.J.
    1.Added EGenStandardTypes.h. This file is where platform dependent data
	types are mapped to platform independent types to be used in the EGen
	package.
    2.Added a typedef of RNGSEED to clearly show where parameters are seeds to
	the RNG and where they are not.
    3.Updated CRandom class to use the 64-bit RNG, and it's associated skip
	function. Note that this caused a change in the returned data type of
	two public methods to type RNGSEED (this change rippled into
	CustomerTable.cpp and AddressTable.cpp).
	    a.GetSeed
	    b.RndNthElement
    4.Reconciled ADDRESS and ZIP_CODE table generation.
	a.Removed Address.txt input file
	b.ADDRESS table generation now uses ZipCode.txt input file for zip
	    codes.
	c.AD_TOWN and AD_DIV columns removed from ADDRESS generation
	d.New ZipCode.txt file created
    5.CO_SP_RATE now uses a weighted distribution across all 39 values instead

    20.New MarketFeed transaction (without TradeLimit):
	TxnHarnessMarketFeed.h: new parameters for CMarketFeed and population
	    of status and trade types by the harness.
	TxnHarnessStructs.h: new input and output structures for MarketFeed
	    and no T1_from_MEE as there is no TradeLimit transaction to time
	    anymore.
	TxnHarnessTradeOrder.h: removed T1_from_MEE 
    21.TxnHarnessTradeOrder.h: do not send to market if roll_it_back flag is
	set
    22.DriverParamSettings.h: added type_is_margin to TradeOrder settings
    23.Driver.cpp: use type_is_margin parameter setting in
	GenerateTradeOrderInput()
    24.change CDriverInput for new Trade Types
    25.CustomerTable.h/cpp : fix C_ST_ID to use the new status type 
    26.Brokers.h: fix B_ST_ID to use the new status type
    27.InputFlatFileDeclarations.h: add eTradeTypeID and eStatusTypeID enums
	because they are used by multiple tables, not only Holdings and Trades
    28.HoldingsAndTradesCommonData.h: remove eTradeTypeID and eStatusTypeID
	enums
    29.DriverInput.h/cpp: modified to use the new RNGSEED type + moved local

	output parameter
    34.DriverParamSettings.h: added stop_loss percentage (for limit sell
	orders)
    35.Queue.h: enqueue() now returns the new size of the queue so there is no
	need to check size() afterwards (when the lock has been released)
    36.MarketEmulator.cpp:
	ReceiveTrade() doesn't call m_queue.size() after m_queue.enqueue()
	DoTrades() doesn't call m_queue.size(), but gets the dequeue status
	    directly from m_queue.dequeue()
	UpdateStockPrice() checks for price not going too far below the low
	    price range bound, instead of below 0.

Changes 3.1=>3.2 by D.J.
    1.Added functionality for flat file generation of News Item and News XRef
	tables.
    2.Changed default database name from "oltp" to "tpce".
    3.Rolled in Sergey's changes for the following
    a.Changed minimum security price from 0.1 to 20.
    b.Changed maximum security price from 200 to 30.
    c.Changed maximum securities per account from 200 to 25.
    4.Fixed bug in DateTime.cpp. The unix code in SetToCurrent was calling
	YMDtoDayno with tm_mon which is 0 based. But YMDtoDayno expects the
	month to be 1 based. 1 is now added to tm_mon in the call to
	YMDtoDayno.

Changes 3.1=>3.2 by S.V.
    1.DriverParamSettings.h: corrected TMarketWatchSettings::IsValid()
	(replaced 33 with 0).

	TMarketFeedMessage.
    6.Added DriverInputMEEIdInterface.h to get MEEId for a symbol in
	TradeOrder parameter generation.
    7.ODBCAccountPermissionLoad.h: changed to load AP_L_NAME before AP_F_NAME
	to conform with the spec.
    8.ODBCSecurityLoad.h: exchanged S_ISSUE and S_TD_ID to conform with the
	spec
    9.MarketEmulator_stdafx.h: removed "#include <iostream>" and "using
	namespace std;" because there is no output with cout operator anymore.
    10.DriverInput.h/cpp: added return of "Executor is account owner" flag for
	Trade Order.
    11.InputFlatFilesDeclarations.h: removed commented code for Taxrates.txt.

	Table_Defs.h: added NEWS_ITEM_ROW and NEWS_XREF_ROW definitions
	InputFlatFilesDeclarations.h: added TNewsFile declaration.
	TxnHarnessStructs.h: changed max_news_len to 2 from 20 (to avoid
	    putting 2MB on stack in SecurityDetailFrame1() - TSDOutput
	    structure).

	    GetCurrentCO_ID().
	EGenLoader.cpp: added -xN switch to suppress NEWS tables generation.

	    recalculating it every time it is needed
	FixedArray.h: changed input validation in [] into an assert that is
	    only used in debug build
	FixedMap.h: changed input validation in GetElement() into an assert
	    that is only used in debug build

Changes rc1-3.1 => rc2-3.1
    1.Enabled generation of TRADE_REQUEST table. DJ
    2.TX_RATE from 0<x<100 to 0<x<1 in input flat file. JF
    3.TX_NAME place holders filled out in input flat file. JF
    4.CDateTime::AddMinutes fixed. SV
    5.FI_OUT_BASIC and FI_OUT_DILUT output flat file formats fixed. DJ
    6.CDateTime::monthArray split into two arrays. SV
    7.makefile - cleaned up ^Ms. DJ
    8.Cleaned up input flat file ZipCode.txt. DJ

Changes 3.0 => 3.1 by S.V.
    1)All code in header files is declared in TPCE namespace. Source files
	have "using namespace TPCE" directive.
    2)DriverInput.h/cpp: CDriverInput class modified to accept distribution
	parameters structure defined in DriverInputSettings.h (new file).
    3)InputFlatFilesDeclarations.h (and all affected files): renamed
	TInputFileNames=>TInputFiles in because this structure contains
	references to actual input files in memory instead of their names.
    4)Changed VC project files to link with DLL version of C++ runtime library
	instead of static runtime library linkage (Project
	Properties->C/C++->Code Generation->Runtime Library)
    5)MarketEmulator.h/cpp: CMarketEmulator keeps internal time for trade and
	for ticker as seconds (with fractions) from the base time, which is
	taken at construction time. This takes care of rounding and 1ms
	resolution problems. The trade frequency constructor parameters are
	now in seconds instead of minutes.
    6)MarketEmulator.cpp: changed NegExp() to use log() instead of logf() all
	the time, so MPL's change to CMarketEmulator is not #ifdef'ed anymore.
    7)MarketEmulator.h/cpp: added a parameter to CMarketEmulator constructor
	for a printf-like function used for informational and debugging output
	(m_bVerbose=true), instead of using cout. This allows for non stdout
	output.
    8)TableConsts.h: organized constants in alphabetical order by table type.
    9)TxnHarnessStructs.h: organized structs in alphabetical order by
	transaction type.
    10)TxnHarnessStructs.h: changed cAD_CTY_len=>cAD_CTRY_len to coincide with
	DJ change.
    11)Error.h/cpp: removed CBufferOverflowErr as it is not used anywhere.
    12)ODBCExchangeLoad.h: binding for EX_AD_ID column changed from type
	SQLFLT8 to type SQLINT4 because address ids are integers.
    13)CustomerTaxratesTable.h: strncpy() TAX_ID field since it it char(4)
	now. Updated  InputFlatFilesDeclarations.h to have char fields in
	TTaxRateInputRow and correspondingly updated TTaxRateInputRow::Load in
	ReadRowFunctions.cpp. Updated CUSTOMER_TAXRATE_ROW in Table_Defs.h.
    14)New Taxrates.h to generate TAXRATE table from new TaxRatesCountry.txt
	and TaxRatesDivision.txt input files instead of Taxrates.txt input
	file.
    15)Removed commented out code:
	DateTime.cpp: for in-class CDateTime::operator> (there is an external
	    operator>)
	ReadRowFunctions.cpp: comment at the end about explicit instantiation
	    of input file templates (there is no actual code corresponding to
	    this comment)
	HoldingsAndTradesTable.h: private m_iTradeType and m_iTradeStatus
	    (they are publicly defined now as they are needed from other
	    tables)
	MarketEmulator.cpp: Sleep(10) along with its comment in DoTrades() as
	    this trick is no longer needed because T_ID is now primary key in
	    HOLDING. Also, trade_dts.fraction=0 (not needed - fraction is
	    properly calculated in GetTimeStamp()).
	TxnHarnessStructs.h: ticker element fields in TMFInput as they are
	    contained in TTickerElement structure now
	Error.h: removed _SERRORMSG and _ErrorLevel declarations

Changes 3.0 => 3.1 by MPL.
    General Items
	MarketEmulator.cpp: logf->log on solaris(used same syntax as  found in
	    Random.cpp)
	TxnHarnessCustomerPosition.h:
	    Changed:  CustPosFrame2.in.cust_id = CustPosFrame1.in.cust_id;
	    To: CustPosFrame2.in.cust_id = CustPosFrame1.out.cust_id;
    There's also quite a bit of code missing from this TxnHarness piece of
	code. Almost none of the output parameters are being passed back to
	the client.  Some of it involves TIMESTAMP_STRUCT copying so we won't
	add our changes in this version.
    Other TxnHarness files that need to be changed: TradeResult, TradeOrder,
	MarketFeed.
    Removed prj/ChangeLog.doc to avoid confusion.
