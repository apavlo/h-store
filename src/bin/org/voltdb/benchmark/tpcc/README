% TPC-C Example Guide

The TPC-C example runs a modified TPC-C benchmark. For the full TPC-C
specification, see www.tpc.org/tpcc/spec/tpcc_current.pdf.

The TPC Benchmark C is an on-line transaction processing (OLTP) benchmark.
TPC-C is more complex than previous OLTP benchmarks such as TPC-A because of
its multiple transaction types, more complex database and overall execution
structure. TPC-C involves a mix of five concurrent transactions of different
types and complexity either executed on-line or queued for deferred
execution. The database is comprised of nine types of tables with a wide
range of record and population sizes. TPC-C is measured in transactions per
minute (tpmC).

TPC-C simulates a complete computing environment where a population of users
executes transactions against a database. The benchmark is centered around
the principal activities (transactions) of an order-entry environment. These
transactions include entering and delivering orders, recording payments,
checking the status of orders, and monitoring the level of stock at the
warehouses.

This example is suitable for using in performance measurements.
